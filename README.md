This is the source for dmvisbot ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmvisbot), [Tumblr](https://dmvisbot.tumblr.com/)). It generates [dmvis](https://github.com/devinacker/dmvis) visualizations of random levels from the worlds of Doom, and is mainly based off of a modified version of [`wadbot2.py`](https://bitbucket.org/JPLeBreton/wadbot/src/aaa08647d9a1f59457581595a5c78b2ea666650d/wadbot2.py) from [JP LeBreton's](http://vectorpoem.com/) [WADbot](http://wadbot.tumblr.com/).
